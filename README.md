# Data Visualization with Python and Plotly
A great way to explore, better understand, and showcase your data is through creating and manipulating data visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps. We'll use [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)--and specifically, [plotly express](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/), to create interactive data visualizations with minimal Python code.

- __[instacart_data](https://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/plotly-data-visualizations/tree/master/instacart_data)__: this folder contains all of the instacart data files under 25 MB--this does not include the *order_products_prior.csv* data set used in the Jupyter notebook
- __[2019-11-04-melanieshimano-data-visualization-plotly-starter](https://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/plotly-data-visualizations/blob/master/2019-11-04-melanieshimano-data-visualization-plotly-starter.ipynb)__: this notebook is a "starter" for the data-visualization-plotly notebook, which means that this includes all of the notes, but no python code
- __[intacart_product_bar_chart.html](https://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/plotly-data-visualizations/blob/master/intacart_product_bar_chart.html)__: this is an html file output of the bar chart output from the instacart data analysis
- __[2019-11-05-melanieshimano-plotly-animations](https://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/plotly-data-visualizations/blob/master/2019-11-05-melanieshimano-plotly-animations.ipynb)__: this notebook shows how to create data visualization animations with plotly express using gapminder and Baltimore City Government salary data
- __[Baltimore_city_salary_changes_animation.html](https://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/plotly-data-visualizations/blob/master/Baltimore_city_salary_changes_animation.html)__: this is an html file output of the data animation of Baltimore City government salary data
