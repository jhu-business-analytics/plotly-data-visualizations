# Data Visualization with Python and Plotly
A great way to explore, better understand, and showcase your data is through creating and manipulating data visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps. We'll use [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)--and specifically, [plotly express](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/), to create interactive data visualizations with minimal Python code.
